# FreeBIRD Token Smart Contract

#Description:

The FreeBIRD Token Smart Contract is a Solidity-based blockchain application designed to manage a custom ERC20 token called FreeBIRD (FB).
The contract includes functionalities for token minting, burning, and transfer, along with administrative controls such as pausing 
and destruction of the contract. It ensures that only the contract owner can perform sensitive operations, maintaining security and integrity.
